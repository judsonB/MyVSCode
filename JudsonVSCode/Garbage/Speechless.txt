Swallowing sand, left with nothing to say

My voice drowned out in the thunder

But I won't cry

And I won't start to crumble

Whenever they try
B
To shut me or cut me down

You can't keep me quiet

Won't tremble when you try it
Am Bm Em C D
All I know is I won't go speechless

Try to lock me in this cage
